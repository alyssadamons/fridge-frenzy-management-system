# fridge-frenzy-management-system
This project is part of a 3rd-year group web development project for a refrigeration business management system.

My responsibility focused on the customer management dashboard which consisted of customers and orders, specifically the Customer Management subsystem.

What I was responsible for:

Customer management (add, edit, view, soft-delete, restore).

Order management (add, edit, view, soft-delete, restore).

Fridge allocation to customers.

Employee dashboard navigation.

Role-based login redirection (customers vs employees).

Admin and Customer Management dashboard UI and layout improvements.

Project Overview:

Fridge Frenzy is a web-based system that allows:

Customers to register, log in, browse products, and manage their profiles

Employees to log in and manage customers, fridges, allocations, and appointments through an admin dashboard

The system uses ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET Identity for authentication and role management.
